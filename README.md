# Raceto100

A Dice Game for Kids. Very simple and enjoyable trivia game that is built completely out of Javascript and using [ChanceJS] (https://chancejs.com/index.html) for randomn number generation and [Tabulator] (https://tabulator.info/) for presenting scores in a nicely formatted table.

## Who is this game for?

This game was built for kids. But, generally anyone likes to play trivia games can try. It's a way to relieve your stress and have fun with your kids.

## How does it work?

Currently, this game can only be played on one device sharing controls with other players. It is best presented on laptops, tablets and desktop computers. In the future, I might introduce a better version to play the game remotely using another device.

## How to get started?

There are 4 ways to get started:

1. If you want to run this locally on your computer, simply download the zip file of this repository, extract the files and click on the index.html
2. If you have git installed on your computer, simply clone the respositor using the following command in your terminal:

3. If you have a personal website, copy the entite folder to a specific path and access your website.
